  This template has been deprecated since the Rocky release and is slated for
  removal in the T release. To achieve the same functionality as this template
  used to provide, look at the docs on how to recursively extend the
  'auth/_login_form.html' template.

  You will want to override the block 'login_footer' in
  'auth/_login_form.html'.

  See 'auth/_login_form.html' in the example theme.
