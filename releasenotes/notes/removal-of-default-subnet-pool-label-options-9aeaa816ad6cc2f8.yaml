deprecations:
    - The 'default_ipv4_subnet_pool_label' and 'default_ipv6_subnet_pool_label'
      options were deprecated in the Mitaka release and are no longer valid in
      the Newton release. Starting with Mitaka you can create one default
      subnet pool per address family through the Neutron API. These subnet
      pools will automatically show up in the subnet pool list using the name
      of the pool as label.
