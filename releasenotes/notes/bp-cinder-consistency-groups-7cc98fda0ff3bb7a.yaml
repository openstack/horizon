    [`blueprint cinder-consistency-groups <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/cinder-consistency-groups>`_]
    This feature adds 2 new tabs to the Project Volumes panel. The first tab
    will display Consistency Groups, and the second tab will display
    Consistency Group Snapshots. Consistency Groups (CG) contain existing
    volumes, and allow the user to perform actions on the volumes in one step.
    Actions include: create/update/delete CGs, snapshot all volumes in a CG,
    clone all volumes in a CG, and create a new CG and volumes from a CG
    snapshot. Policies associated with Consistency Groups exist in the Cinder
    policy file, and by default, all actions are disabled.
