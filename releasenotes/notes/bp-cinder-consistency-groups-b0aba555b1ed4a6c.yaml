    [`blueprint cinder-consistency-groups <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/cinder-consistency-groups>`_]
    This feature adds a new Consistency Groups tab to the Project Volumes panel.
    Consistency Groups (GG) contain existing volumes, and allow the user to perform
    actions on the volumes in one step. Actions include: create a CG, manage volumes
    associated with the CG, update a CG, and delete a CGs. Note that a CG can not be
    deleted if it contains any volumes.
security:
  - Policies associated with Consistency Groups exist in the Cinder policy file, and
    by default, all actions are disabled.
