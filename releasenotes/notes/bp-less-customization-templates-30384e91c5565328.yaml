features:
  - |
    With the fixes in Rocky that allow using Django's recursive template
    inheritance we have added new blocks in our ``base.html`` template to allow
    a better means of customizing through your themes. For details see the
    ``customizing`` docs.
deprecations:
  - |
    The customization override templates have been deprecated in favor of using
    recursive inheritance in your themes. The following templates have been
    deprecated and are slated for removal in the U release:
    * ``_footer.html'``
    * ``_login_footer.html``
    * ``_login_form_footer.html``
    * ``horizon/_custom_head_js.html``
    * ``horizon/_custom_meta.html``
upgrade:
  - |
    To allow certain views to optionally disable analytics tracking when
    handling sensitive data, don't use the ``custom_head_js`` block, or the now
    deprecated template ``horizon/_custom_head_js.html`` for analytics
    tracking. Please read the ``customizing`` docs and instead use the
    dedicated ``custom_analytics`` block so Horizon or its plugins can when
    needed disable tracking on a given view.
