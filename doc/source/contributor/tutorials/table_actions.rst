Tutorial: Adding a complex action to a table
============================================

This tutorial covers how to add a more complex action to a table, one that
requires an action and form definitions, as well as changes to the view, urls,
and table.

This tutorial assumes you have already completed
:ref:`tutorials-dashboard`. If not, please do so now as we will be
modifying the files created there.

This action will create a snapshot of the instance. When the action is taken,
it will display a form that will allow the user to enter a snapshot name,
and will create that snapshot when the form is closed using the ``Create
snapshot`` button.

Defining the view
=================

To define the view, we must create a view class, along with the template
(``HTML``) file and the form class for that view.

The template file
-----------------
The template file contains the HTML that will be used to show the view.

Create a ``create_snapshot.html`` file under the ``mypanel/templates/mypanel``
directory and add the following code::

    {% extends 'base.html' %}
    {% load i18n %}
    {% block title %}{% trans "Create Snapshot" %}{% endblock %}

    {% block page_header %}
      {% include "horizon/common/_page_header.html" with title=_("Create a Snapshot") %}
    {% endblock page_header %}

    {% block main %}
        {% include 'mydashboard/mypanel/_create_snapshot.html' %}
    {% endblock %}


As you can see, the main body will be defined in ``_create_snapshot.html``,
so we must also create that file under the ``mypanel/templates/mypanel``
directory. It should contain the following code::

    {% extends "horizon/common/_modal_form.html" %}
    {% load i18n %}

    {% block modal-body-right %}
        <h3>{% trans "Description:" %}</h3>
        <p>{% trans "Snapshots preserve the disk state of a running instance." %}</p>
    {% endblock %}


The form
--------

Horizon provides a :class:`~horizon.forms.base.SelfHandlingForm` class which
simplifies some of the details involved in creating a form. Our form will
derive from this class, adding a character field to allow the user to specify
a name for the snapshot, and handling the successful closure of the form by
calling the nova api to create the snapshot.

Create the ``forms.py`` file under the ``mypanel`` directory and add the
following::

    from django.urls import reverse
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

    from horizon import exceptions
    from horizon import forms

    from openstack_dashboard import api


    class CreateSnapshot(forms.SelfHandlingForm):
        instance_id = forms.CharField(label=_("Instance ID"),
                                      widget=forms.HiddenInput(),
                                      required=False)
        name = forms.CharField(max_length=255, label=_("Snapshot Name"))

        def handle(self, request, data):
            try:
                snapshot = api.nova.snapshot_create(request,
                                                    data['instance_id'],
                                                    data['name'])
                return snapshot
            except Exception:
                exceptions.handle(request,
                                  _('Unable to create snapshot.'))


The view
--------

Now, the view will tie together the template and the form. Horizon provides a
:class:`~horizon.forms.views.ModalFormView` class which simplifies the creation
of a view that will contain a modal form.

Open the ``views.py`` file under the ``mypanel`` directory and add the code
for the CreateSnapshotView and the necessary imports. The complete
file should now look something like this::

    from django.urls import reverse
    from django.urls import reverse_lazy
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

    from horizon import tabs
    from horizon import exceptions
    from horizon import forms

    from horizon.utils import memoized

    from openstack_dashboard import api

    from openstack_dashboard.dashboards.mydashboard.mypanel \
        import forms as project_forms

    from openstack_dashboard.dashboards.mydashboard.mypanel \
        import tabs as mydashboard_tabs


    class IndexView(tabs.TabbedTableView):
        tab_group_class = mydashboard_tabs.MypanelTabs
        # A very simple class-based view...
        template_name = 'mydashboard/mypanel/index.html'

        def get_data(self, request, context, *args, **kwargs):
            # Add data to the context here...
            return context


    class CreateSnapshotView(forms.ModalFormView):
        form_class = project_forms.CreateSnapshot
        template_name = 'mydashboard/mypanel/create_snapshot.html'
        success_url = reverse_lazy("horizon:project:images:index")
        modal_id = "create_snapshot_modal"
        modal_header = _("Create Snapshot")
        submit_label = _("Create Snapshot")
        submit_url = "horizon:mydashboard:mypanel:create_snapshot"

        @memoized.memoized_method
        def get_object(self):
            try:
                return api.nova.server_get(self.request,
                                           self.kwargs["instance_id"])
            except Exception:
                exceptions.handle(self.request,
                                  _("Unable to retrieve instance."))

        def get_initial(self):
            return {"instance_id": self.kwargs["instance_id"]}

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            context = super(CreateSnapshotView, self).get_context_data(**kwargs)
            instance_id = self.kwargs['instance_id']
            context['instance_id'] = instance_id
            context['instance'] = self.get_object()
            context['submit_url'] = reverse(self.submit_url, args=[instance_id])
            return context


Adding the url
==============

We must add the url for our new view.  Open the ``urls.py`` file under
the ``mypanel`` directory and add the following as a new url pattern::

    url(r'^(?P<instance_id>[^/]+)/create_snapshot/$',
        views.CreateSnapshotView.as_view(),
        name='create_snapshot'),

The complete ``urls.py`` file should look like this::

    from django.conf.urls import url

    from openstack_dashboard.dashboards.mydashboard.mypanel import views


    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^$',
            views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index'),
        url(r'^(?P<instance_id>[^/]+)/create_snapshot/$',
            views.CreateSnapshotView.as_view(),
            name='create_snapshot'),
    ]



Define the action
=================

Horizon provides a :class:`~horizon.tables.LinkAction` class which simplifies
adding an action which can be used to display another view.

We will add a link action to the table that will be accessible from each row
in the table. The action will use the view defined above to create a snapshot
of the instance represented by the row in the table.

To do this, we must edit the ``tables.py`` file under the ``mypanel`` directory
and add the following::

    def is_deleting(instance):
        task_state = getattr(instance, "OS-EXT-STS:task_state", None)
        if not task_state:
            return False
        return task_state.lower() == "deleting"


    class CreateSnapshotAction(tables.LinkAction):
        name = "snapshot"
        verbose_name = _("Create Snapshot")
        url = "horizon:mydashboard:mypanel:create_snapshot"
        classes = ("ajax-modal",)
        icon = "camera"

        # This action should be disabled if the instance
        # is not active, or the instance is being deleted
        def allowed(self, request, instance=None):
            return instance.status in ("ACTIVE") \
                and not is_deleting(instance)


We must also add our new action as a row action for the table::

    row_actions = (CreateSnapshotAction,)


The complete ``tables.py`` file should look like this::

    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

    from horizon import tables


    def is_deleting(instance):
        task_state = getattr(instance, "OS-EXT-STS:task_state", None)
        if not task_state:
            return False
        return task_state.lower() == "deleting"


    class CreateSnapshotAction(tables.LinkAction):
        name = "snapshot"
        verbose_name = _("Create Snapshot")
        url = "horizon:mydashboard:mypanel:create_snapshot"
        classes = ("ajax-modal",)
        icon = "camera"

        def allowed(self, request, instance=None):
            return instance.status in ("ACTIVE") \
                and not is_deleting(instance)


    class MyFilterAction(tables.FilterAction):
        name = "myfilter"


    class InstancesTable(tables.DataTable):
        name = tables.Column("name", verbose_name=_("Name"))
        status = tables.Column("status", verbose_name=_("Status"))
        zone = tables.Column('availability_zone', verbose_name=_("Availability Zone"))
        image_name = tables.Column('image_name', verbose_name=_("Image Name"))

        class Meta(object):
            name = "instances"
            verbose_name = _("Instances")
            table_actions = (MyFilterAction,)
            row_actions = (CreateSnapshotAction,)


Run and check the dashboard
===========================

We must once again run horizon to verify our dashboard is working::

    $ tox -e runserver -- 0:9000


Go to ``http://<your server>:9000`` using a browser. After login as an admin,
display ``My Panel`` to see the ``Instances`` table. For every ``ACTIVE``
instance in the table, there will be a ``Create Snapshot`` action on the row.
Click on ``Create Snapshot``, enter a snapshot name in the form that is shown,
then click to close the form. The ``Project Images`` view should be shown with
the new snapshot added to the table.


Conclusion
==========

What you've learned here is the fundamentals of how to add a table action that
requires a form for data entry. This can easily be expanded from creating a
snapshot to other API calls that require more complex forms to gather the
necessary information.
