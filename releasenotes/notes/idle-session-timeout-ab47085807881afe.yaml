features:
  - |
    New setting ``SESSION_REFRESH`` (defaults to ``True``) that allows the user
    session expiry to be refreshed for every request until the token itself
    expires. ``SESSION_TIMEOUT`` acts as an idle timeout value now.
upgrade:
  - |
    ``SESSION_TIMEOUT`` now by default acts as an idle timeout rather than a
    hard timeout limit. If you wish to retain the old hard timeout
    functionality set ``SESSION_REFRESH`` to ``False``.
