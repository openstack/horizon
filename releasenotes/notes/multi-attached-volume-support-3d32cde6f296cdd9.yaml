    [:blueprint:`multi-Attached-volume-support`]
    Horizon now support Multi-Attached volume.
    User is now able to attach a volume to multiple
    instances. The ability to attach a volume to
    multiple host/servers requires that the volume
    type includes an extra-spec capability setting of
    multiattach=<is> True. Horizon automatically detects
    and enable multi-attach-volume feature.

    API restrictions:
      Multiattach capable volumes can only be attached
      with nova API microversion 2.60 or later.
