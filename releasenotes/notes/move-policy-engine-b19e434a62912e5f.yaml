upgrade:
  - The main engine managing integration with oslo.policy has been moved
    to django_openstack_auth. The configuration is still managed in
    Horizon, but the setting for ``POLICY_CHECK_FUNCTION`` now uses
    ``openstack_auth.policy.check`` rather than
    ``openstack_dashboard.policy.check``. Current behavior will
    remain consistent.
