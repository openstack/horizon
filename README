OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon)
-----------------------------

The OpenStack Dashboard is a Django based reference implementation of a web
based management interface for OpenStack.

It is based on django-openstack, which is designed to be a generic Django
module that can be re-used in other sites.

For more information about how to get started with the OpenStack Dashboard,
view the README file in the openstack-dashboard folder.

For more information about working directly with django-openstack, see the
README file in the django-openstack folder.

Project Structure and Testing:
------------------------------

This project is a bit different from other Openstack projects in that it has
two very distinct components underneath it: django-openstack, and
openstack-dashboard.

django-openstack holds the generic libraries and components that can be
used in any Django project. In testing, this component is set up with
buildout (see run_tests.sh), and any dependencies that get added need to
be added to the django-openstack/buildout.cfg file.

openstack-dashboard is a reference django project that uses django-openstack
and is built with a virtualenv and tested through that environment. If
depdendencies are added that the reference django project needs, they
should be added to openstack-dashboard/tools/pip-requires.

The run_tests.sh script invokes tests and analysis on both of these
components in it's process, and is what Jenkins uses to verify the
stability of the project.

To run the tests::

    $ ./run_tests.sh

Building Contributor Documentation
----------------------------------

This documentation is written by contributors, for contributors.

The source is maintained in the `doc/source` folder using
`reStructuredText`_ and built by `Sphinx`_

.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

* Building Automatically::

    $ ./run_tests.sh --docs

* Building Manually::

    $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=local.local_settings
    $ python doc/generate_autodoc_index.py
    $ sphinx-build -b html doc/source build/sphinx/html

Results are in the `build/sphinx/html` directory
