upgrade:
  - |
    ``publicize_image`` policy now has the same name both for image create and
    edit features and corresponds to the same one in Glance. If you changed the
    policy name manually to get feature working you have to rollback your
    changes before Horizon update.
fixes:
  - |
    [:bug:`1859041`] ``image:publicize_image`` policy is renamed to
    ``publicize_image`` to be the same as Glance has.
