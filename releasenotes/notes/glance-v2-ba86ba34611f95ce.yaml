features:
  - Adds complete support for Glance v2 so that Horizon no longer depends on
    having a Glance v1 endpoint in the Keystone catalog. Also provides
    code compatibility between Glance v1 and v2.
  - Adds a new config value called IMAGES_ALLOW_LOCATION, which allows users
    to set locations when creating or updating images. Depending on the Glance
    version, the ability to set locations is controlled by policies and/or
    configuration values.
upgrade:
  - The OPENSTACK_IMAGE_FORMATS variable must be added to the
    REST_API_REQUIRED_SETTINGS setting in local_settings.py
issues:
  - If you set 'images_panel' to False for the ANGULAR_FEATURES option (which
    is not the default) and configure Horizon to use Glance v2, Ramdisk ID and
    Kernel ID don't show properly on the "Edit Image" screen.
other:
  - Glance v2 doesn't support the copy-from feature, so this feature is
    disabled in Horizon when using Glance v2.
  - The output from the Glance image list API has changed between v1 and v2
    such that admins logged into Horizon will now see all images in the cloud
    on the Project->Compute->Images panel.
