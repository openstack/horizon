    [:bug:`1795851`] Operators now can control whether the links of
    "Download OpenRC" and "Download clouds.yaml" are displayed or not
    via new settings ``SHOW_OPENRC_FILE`` and ``SHOW_OPENSTACK_CLOUDS_YAML``.
    ``openrc`` and ``clouds.yaml`` files provided by horizon now assume
    the basic simple deployment and do not cover keystone authentication
    like saml2, openid and so on. The default ``openrc`` and ``clouds.yaml``
    from horizon do not make sense for such environments.

    Custom templates for ``clouds.yaml`` and ``openrc`` files can be
    configured now via ``OPENSTACK_CLOUDS_YAML_CUSTOM_TEMPLATE`` and
    ``OPENRC_CUSTOM_TEMPLATE`` settings. For more detail, see the
    `Settings Reference <https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/configuration/settings.html>`__.

    ``ADD_TEMPLATE_DIRS`` setting is also added so that operators can place
    custom templates for ``clouds.yaml`` at deployment-specific paths.
