    ``OPENSTACK_NOVA_EXTENSIONS_BLACKLIST`` setting is now dropped.
    If you specify ``SimpleTenantUsage`` in this setting, consider setting
    ``OPENSTACK_USE_SIMPLE_TENANT_USAGE`` to ``False`` instead.
    For other effective values in this setting, no replacement is
    provided as nova provides all features in recent versions of nova API.
    Note that you can enable/disable table actions via policy rules.
