features:
  - Cinder defines storage size in gibibytes (GiB), which is inconsistent with
    Horizon panels that show/request storage size in gigabytes (GB).
    All Volume related panels in Horizon that previously used the term "GB" and
    "gigabyte" have been replaced with 'GiB' and 'gibibyte'.
issues:
  - There are also some Nova related panels (e.g. "Instances") that reference
    storage size in "GB". These panels will be addressed in subsequent patches.
fixes:
  - blueprint gb-to-gib-conversion <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/gb-to-gib-conversion/>
