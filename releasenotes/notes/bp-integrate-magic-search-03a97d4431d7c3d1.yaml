    [`blueprint integrate-magic-search <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/integrate-magic-search>`_]
    Magic Search was an external dependency that was being heavily modified or
    overwritten in sections, so the used parts of code base have been moved
    into Horizon.

upgrade:
  - Horizon no longer requires Magic Search as an external dependency.
