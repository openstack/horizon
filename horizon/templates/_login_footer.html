  This template has been deprecated since the Rocky release and is slated for
  removal in the T release. To achieve the same functionality as this template
  used to provide, look at the docs on how to recursively extend the
  'auth/login.html' template.

  You will want to override the block 'footer' in 'auth/login.html'.

  See 'auth/login.html' in the example theme.
