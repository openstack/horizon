# in effect, the user will be prompted to choose a floating IP

#
# You may remove settings from this list for security purposes, but do so at
# the risk of breaking a built-in horizon feature. These settings are required
# for horizon to function properly. Only remove them if you know what you
# are doing. These settings may in the future be moved to be defined within
# the enabled panel configuration.
# You should not add settings to this list for out of tree extensions.
