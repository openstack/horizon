   * Provides a wrapper for translation, using the global 'gettext'
   * function if it is present.  Provides a method that
   * simply returns the input if the expected global 'gettext' is
   * not provided.
   *
   * Ideally once gettext is no longer needed on a global scope,
   * the global ref can be deleted here.  For now that is not possible.
   * Also, if future alternate means were provided, we could put that
   * logic here.
   *
   * This could also be done in the context of the filter, but
   * the approach taken here was to separate business logic
   * (translation) from filters, which are arguably more
   * presentation-oriented.
