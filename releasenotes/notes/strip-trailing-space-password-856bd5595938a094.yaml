    Password forms in horizon now does not strip leading/trailing spaces
    included in input passwords. Previously horizon stripped leading/trailing
    spaces in input passwords but on the other hand keystone accepts
    leading/trailing spaces and it can be an issue when such passwords are
    set via keystone API. To handle this situation horizon no longer strips
    leading/trailing spaces in passwords.
    See [:bug:`1861224`] and
    `the related mailing thread <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-discuss/2020-January/thread.html#12222>`__
    for more detail.
    (Note that this change is part of horizon 18.5.0 release
    but we forgot to mention it.)
