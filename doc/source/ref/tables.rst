==================
Horizon DataTables
==================

.. module:: horizon.tables

Horizon includes a componentized API for programmatically creating tables
in the UI. Why would you want this? It means that every table renders
correctly and consistently, table- and row-level actions all have a consistent
API and appearance, and generally you don't have to reinvent the wheel or
copy-and-paste every time you need a new table!

    For usage information, tips & tricks and more examples check out the :doc:`DataTables Topic
    Guide </topics/tables>`.

DataTable
=========

The core class which defines the high-level structure of the table being
represented. Example::

    class MyTable(DataTable):
        name = Column('name')
        email = Column('email')

        class Meta:
            name = "my_table"
            table_actions = (MyAction, MyOtherAction)
            row_actions = (MyAction,)
