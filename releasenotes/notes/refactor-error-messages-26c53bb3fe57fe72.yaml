    [`blueprint refactor-error-messages <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/refactor-error-messages>`_]
    User can see detailed error message on the horizon UI.
    This blueprint adds a hyperlink "details" in the alert box.
    So now when an exception occurs a user can click on this hyperlink
    "details" which shows original error message included in a corresponding
    error. This may help a user to understand what happens in detail.
