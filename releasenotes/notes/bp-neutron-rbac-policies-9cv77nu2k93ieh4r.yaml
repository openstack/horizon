    [`blueprint neutron-rbac-policies <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/rbac-policies>`_]
    This blueprint adds RBAC policies panel to the Admin Network group.
    This panel will be enabled by default when the RBAC extension is
    enabled. Remove this panel by setting "'enable_rbac_policy': False"
    in 'local_settings.py'. RBAC policy supports the control of two
    resources: networks and qos policies, because qos policies is
    an extension function of neutron, need to enable this extension
    if wants to use it.
