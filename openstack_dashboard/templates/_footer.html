  This template has been deprecated since the Rocky release and is slated for
  removal in the T release. To achieve the same functionality as this template
  used to provide, look at the docs on how to recursively extend the
  'base.html' template.

  You will want to override the block 'footer' in 'base.html'.

  See 'base.html' in the example theme.
