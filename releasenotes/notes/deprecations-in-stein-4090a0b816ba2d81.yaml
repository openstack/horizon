deprecations:
  - Keystone v2 API support in horizon will be dropped in Train release.
    It was was removed from keystone in Queens release.
  - Cinder consistency group support in horizon will be dropped in
    Train release or later. It was deprecated in Pike release in Cinder
    and was superseded by the generic group feature.
    Horizon supports the generic group since Rocky release.
  - Volume v2 API support is now deprecated. The API has been marked
    as deprecated in cinder in favor of volume v3 API. Horizon will
    drop volume v2 API support in a same release where cinder drops it.
  - Glance v1 API support is now deprecated and will be dropped in
    Train release at earliest. It was removed from glance in Rokcy release.
  - Nova-network support will be dropped in Train release completely.
    Horizon dropped nova-network floating IP and security gruop supports
    in Queens release, but we still supports operations on server instances
    created with nova-network. This deprecation means such support will be
    dropped in the near future and horizon will assume neutron is deployed.
