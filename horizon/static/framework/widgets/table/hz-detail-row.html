<!--
  Default detail row template

  May be overridden.

  The responsive columns that disappear typically should reappear here
  with the same responsive priority that they disappear.
  E.g. table header with rsp-p2 should be here with rsp-alt-p2
  The layout should minimize vertical space to reduce scrolling.

<div class="row">
  <span class="rsp-alt-p2">
    <dl class="col-sm-2" ng-repeat="column in config.columns">
      <dt translate>{$ column.title $}</dt>
      <dd translate><hz-cell></hz-cell></dd>
    </dl>
  </span>
</div>
