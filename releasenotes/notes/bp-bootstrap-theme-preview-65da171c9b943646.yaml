features:
    - Added the Developer dashboard plugin to contrib. This runs when
      ``DEBUG=True``, and adds tooling to the UI to aid in development.
    - Added the Bootstrap Theme Preview panel to the Developer dashboard. This
      panel contains a list of Bootstrap components with source code, so that
      developers can see examples of how to structure this code and the
      effects their theme will have upon it.
