deprecations:
    - The 'webroot' theme has been removed.

fixes:
  - The 'webroot' theme was providing an example of
    how to set the webroot value through SCSS for
    accessing needed static URL prefixes for assets
    like font paths. This value is now retrieved
    directly from the Django settings and is available
    directly in the SCSS namespace via $static_url.
