features:
  - Added support for managing domains and projects when using Keystone v3.
    Horizon now maintains a domain scoped token for users who have a role on a
    domain, a project scoped token for users who have a role on a project, or
    both a domain scoped token and project scoped token for users who have
    roles on both.

    Domain management supports the following use cases:

    * Cloud Admin - View and manage identity resources across domains
    * Domain Admin - View and manage identity resources in the domain logged in
    * User - View identity project in the domain logged in

    Current limitations on managing identity resources with Keystone v3:

    * Does not support role assignments across domains, such as giving a user
      in domain1 access to domain2.
    * Does not support project admins managing Keystone projects.
    * Does not support hierarchical project management.
