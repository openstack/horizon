    The legacy way to retrive neutron resource usages is deprecated.
    In future, horizon will require ``quota_details`` neutron extension.
    In the legacy way, horizon list all related resources to count resource usage.
    It is not efficient and ``quota_details`` neutron extension was added
    to address it. It was implemented in Pike release and the enough migration
    period has passed, so we deprecate the legacy way.
