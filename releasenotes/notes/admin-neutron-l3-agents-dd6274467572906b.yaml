   [`blueprint admin-neutron-l3-agent <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/admin-neutron-l3-agent>`_]
   Add support for managing neutron L3 agent hosts. The admin screen for system
   information now provides links / views to see what routers reside on what
   hosts. In addition, the admin view of routers now also provides a list of
   where the router is hosted and the link to see what other routers are
   sharing the same host.
