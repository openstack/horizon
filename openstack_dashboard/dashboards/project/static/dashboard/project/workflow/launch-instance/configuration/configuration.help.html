  <h1 translate>Configuration Help</h1>
  <p translate>Custom scripts are attached to instances to perform specific actions when the instance is launched. For example, if you are unable to install <samp>cloud-init</samp> inside a guest operating system, you can use a custom script to get a public key and add it to the user account.</p>
  <p translate>Type your script directly into the Customization Script field. If your browser supports the HTML5 File API, you may choose to load your script from a file. The size of your script should not exceed 16 Kb.</p>
  <p translate>An advanced option available when launching an instance is disk partitioning. There are two disk partition options. Selecting <b>Automatic</b> resizes the disk and sets it to a single partition. Selecting <b>Manual</b> allows you to create multiple partitions on the disk.</p>
  <p translate>Check the <b>Configuration Drive</b> box if you want to write metadata to a special configuration drive. When the instance boots, it attaches to the <b>Configuration Drive</b> and accesses the metadata.</p>
