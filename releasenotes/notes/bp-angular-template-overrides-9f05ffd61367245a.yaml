    [`blueprint angular-template-overrides <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/angular-template-overrides>`_]
    This blueprint provides a way for deployers to use a theme to override HTML
    fragments used by Angular code in Horizon.  For example, to override the
    launch instance help panel when the 'material' theme is used, create
    openstack_dashboard/themes/material/static/templates/framework
    /widgets/help-panel/help-panel.html. All of the client side templates are
    now compiled into a single JavaScript file that is minified and is given
    as an additional file in the manifest.json file.
