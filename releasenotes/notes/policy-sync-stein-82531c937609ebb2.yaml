upgrade:
  - |
    policy.json files for Cinder, Keystone Neutron and Nova are generated
    according to
    `Policy file maintenance <https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/contributor/topics/policy.html#policy-file-maintenance/>`__.
    Keystone changes to
    `policy rules <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/keystone/stein.html#prelude>__`,
    are not compatible with the Horizon so we keystone_policy.json is not
    updated. Please, be sure that new Keystone policies are compatible with
    your deployment before syncing them.
