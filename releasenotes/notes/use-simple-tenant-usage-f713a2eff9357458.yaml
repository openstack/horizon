    A new setting ``OPENSTACK_USE_SIMPLE_TENANT_USAGE`` was introduced
    as a replacement of ``SimpleTenantUsage`` in
    the deprecated ``OPENSTACK_NOVA_EXTENSIONS_BLACKLIST`` setting.
    This new setting controls whether ``SimpleTenantUsage`` nova API is used
    in the usage overview. According to feedbacks to the horizon team,
    the usage of ``SimpleTenantUsage`` can cause performance issues in the
    nova API in larger deployments.
    Try to set this to ``False`` for such cases.

    ``OPENSTACK_USE_SIMPLE_TENANT_USAGE``
