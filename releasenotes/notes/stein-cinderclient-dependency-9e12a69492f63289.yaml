    python-cinderclient ``>=4.0.1`` is now required to fix :bug:`1824017`.
    Cinder API 3.55 or later does not accept additional properties but
    python-cinderclient older than 4.0.0 sends additional properties like
    used_id, status and so on. Horizon uses Cinder API 3.58 to create a volume,
    and this means the volume creation fails if python-cinderclient <4.0.0
    is used. To handle this, the minimum requirement of python-cinderclient
    was bumped to 4.0.1.
