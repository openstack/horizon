"(For Horizon plugin developers) The AVAIL_CHANGED event of transfer table is "
"removed. It is superseded by event TABLES_CHANGED. The name of AVAIL_CHANGED "
"was misleading because it implicitly and uncontrollably updated the "
"allocated table too. The new event allows independent updates to all four "
"tables. We believe it is safe to remove AVAIL_CHANGED without deprecation "
"because its implementation contained a bug that must have been discovered "
"before if anybody had used it. Anyway possible out-of-tree plugin "
"maintainers are recommended to consume the new event even if your plugins "
"relied on the buggy behavior of AVAIL_CHANGED."
