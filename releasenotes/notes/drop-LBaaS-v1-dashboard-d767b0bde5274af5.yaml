upgrade:
  - LBaaS v1 dashboard has been removed.
    LBaaS v1 feature was removed from neutron-lbaas in Newton, but LBaaS v1
    dashboard in Horizon has been kept only for backward compatibility in
    Newton release so that operators can upgrade Horizon first.
    Note that the Dashboard support for LBaaS v2 is provided as
    a Horizon plugin via `neutron-lbaas-dashboard project
    <https://opendev.org/openstack/neutron-lbaas-dashboard/>`__.
