deprecations:
    - The 'default_ipv4_subnet_pool_label' and 'default_ipv6_subnet_pool_label'
      options has been deprecated and will be removed in the Newton release.
      Starting with Mitaka you can create one default subnet pool per address
      family through the Neutron API. These subnet pools will automatically
      show up in the subnet pool list using the name of the pool as label.
