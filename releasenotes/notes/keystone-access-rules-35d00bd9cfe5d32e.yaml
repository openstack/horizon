    Adds support for access rules for application credentials. Fine-grained
    restrictions can now be applied to application credentials by supplying a
    list of access rules upon creation. See the `keystone documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3/#application-credentials>`_
    for more information.
