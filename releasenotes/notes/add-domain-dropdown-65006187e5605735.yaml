    Added settings OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_DOMAIN_DROPDOWN (boolean) and
    OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_DOMAIN_CHOICES (tuple of tuples) to support a dropdown
    list of keystone domains to choose from at login. This should NOT be enabled
    for public clouds, as advertising enabled domains to unauthenticated users
    irresponsibly exposes private information. This is useful for private clouds
    that sit behind a corporate firewall and that have a small number of domains
    mapped to known corporate structures, such as an LDAP directory, Active
    Directory domains, geopgraphical regions or business units.
