features:
  - Added the angular extensible service which allows angular horizon elements
    such as workflows, tables, actions, and forms to be extended dynamically by
    adding, removing, or replacing items. The extensible service is applied to
    every workflow created using the horizon workflow service. This includes the
    angular Launch Instance workflow.
