deprecations:
  - LBaaS v1 dashboard is now deprecated and will be removed in Ocata release.
    LBaaS v1 feature was removed from neutron-lbaas in Ocata and
    this functionality in Horizon is only for backward compatibility
    so that operators can upgrade Horizon first.
    Note that the Dashboard support for LBaaS v2 is provided as
    a Horizon plugin via `neutron-lbaas-dashboard project
    <https://opendev.org/openstack/neutron-lbaas-dashboard/>`__.
