    Django 2.2 is supported as experimental.
    Django 1.11 (LTS) and 2.0 are supported as well as Stein release does
    and Django 1.11 is still the primary supported version of Django.

    Note that only horizon is verified with Django 2.2 and most horizon
    plugins are not verified with Django 2.2. If you enable horizon plugins
    in your environment, we would suggest to use Django 1.11 or 2.0.
    Be careful when you enable horizon plugins with Django 2.2.
