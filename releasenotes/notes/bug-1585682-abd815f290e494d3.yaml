upgrade:
  - It is no longer necessary to include the version suffix into
    OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_URL setting. Thanks to a recent update of
    django-openstack-auth library as of 2.3.0 release, Horizon will
    append the proper version suffix to the URL based on the value
    stored inside OPENSTACK_API_VERSIONS['identity'] setting.
fixes:
  - |
    [`bug 1585682 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1585682>`__]
    Horizon now properly versions Keystone webpath endpoints (URLs like
    ``http://<hostip>/identity`` instead of ``http://<hostip>:5000``).
