prelude: >
    Horizon no longer requires Nova (or Glance) to function;
    it will run as long as keystone is present (for instance,
    swift-only deployments).
features:
  - Nova and Glance are no longer required in order to run
    Horizon. As long as keystone is present, Horizon will
    run correctly.
