      Change the volume type of a volume after its creation.
      This is equivalent to the <tt>openstack volume set --type</tt> command.

  <p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
      The "Type" selected must be different from the current volume type.

      The "Migration Policy" is only used if the volume retype cannot be
      completed. If the "Migration Policy" is "On Demand", the back end will
      perform volume migration. Note that migration may take a significant
      amount of time to complete, in some cases hours.
