    A port represents a virtual switch port on a logical network switch.
</p>
<p translate>
    Ports can be created under a network by administrators.
</p>
<p translate>
    Virtual instances attach their interfaces to ports.
</p>
<p translate>
    The logical port also defines the MAC address and the IP address(es) to be assigned to the interfaces plugged into them.
</p>
<p translate>
    When IP addresses are associated to a port, this also implies the port is associated with a subnet, as the IP address was taken from the allocation pool for a specific subnet.

    When the <b>Admin State</b> for a port is set to <b>Up</b> and it has no <b>Device Owner</b>,
    then the port is available for use. You can set the <b>Admin State</b> to <b>Down</b>
    if you are not ready for other users to use the port.
</p>

    The status indicates whether the port has an active connection.
