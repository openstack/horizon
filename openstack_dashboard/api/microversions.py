# explicit functioning versions, not a range.
# There should be a minimum of two versions per feature. The first entry in
# this list should always be the lowest possible API microversion for a
# feature i.e. the version at which that feature was introduced. The second
# entry should be the current service version when the feature was added to
# horizon.
