    ``enable_quotas`` in ``OPENSTACK_NEUTRON_NETWORK`` is now enabled
    by default. Neutron provides the quotas API for long and most horizon
    deployments are expected to enable this, so the feature is enabled
    by default. If your deployment disables the neutron quotas support,
    make sure to set this value to ``False``.
